# Coding Prompt Engineer MCP Server

This Model Context Protocol (MCP) server provides a tool to rewrite coding prompts for optimal results with Cursor AI and other AI IDEs, using Claude by Anthropic.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Install via Smithery

You can install this MCP server directly through Smithery by visiting:
https://smithery.ai/server/@hireshBrem/prompt-engineer-mcp-server

## Usage

### Setting Environment Variables

The server requires an Anthropic API key to use Claude for formatting. Set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
```

If no API key is provided, the server will throw an error indicating the missing API key.

### Running the Server

```bash
npm start
```

Or with MCP Inspector:
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npm start
```

## Tool: rewrite_coding_prompt

This tool takes a raw prompt and rewrites it for optimal results with Cursor AI and other AI IDEs.

### Parameters

- `prompt` (required): The raw user's prompt that needs rewriting
- `language` (required): The programming language of the code

### Example Usage

```json
{
  "name": "rewrite_coding_prompt",
  "arguments": {
    "prompt": "Create a function to convert temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit",
    "language": "typescript"
  }
}
```

## How It Works

The server uses Claude 3 Sonnet by Anthropic to intelligently rewrite your prompts for better results. It enhances your prompt by:

1. Adding clear structure and context
2. Specifying requirements and expectations
3. Including language-specific considerations
4. Optimizing for AI IDE understanding

## Features

- **Intelligent Prompt Engineering**: Uses Claude 3 Sonnet to rewrite prompts for optimal results
- **Language-Aware**: Customizes prompts based on target programming language
- **Easy Integration**: Works seamlessly with Cursor and other AI IDEs
- **Low Temperature Setting**: Uses 0.2 temperature for consistent, structured output

## Configuration

### Usage with Claude Desktop
Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

### NPX

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cursor-prompt-engineer": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "cursor-prompt-engineer"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Local Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cursor-prompt-engineer.git
cd cursor-prompt-engineer

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the server
node index.js
```

## Example

Input:
```
Create a function that sorts an array of objects by a specific property
```

With arguments:
```json
{
  "prompt": "Create a function that sorts an array of objects by a specific property",
  "language": "typescript"
}
```

The tool will rewrite the prompt to be more structured and detailed for optimal results with your AI IDE.
